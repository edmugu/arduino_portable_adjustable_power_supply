While doing test on my board, I wanted to compared it to the orignal board on the article used as a templated for this project. So I decided to look for demo boards for the same components used on the article. AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!! I found the orignal board analog descrived still being sold on mouser.com. So I bought one to be able to compare it to my board.
